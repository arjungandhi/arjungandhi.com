# The Blurb

After my misadventures as a student in the senior level robotics courses for some reason my professors thought it was a great idea to encourage other students with my bad ideas. So they made me an SA(like a TA minus the grading). Over my time teaching RBE 3001 & 3002, I learned alot from my students, professors, and got really proficient with the course material. 

# Stuff I did
  - Installed Ubuntu on 60+ different laptops
  - Aided with lab and course design
  - Ran last minute panic sessions to teach material before tests
  - Developed and documented lab materials 
  - Got really good at debugging and understanding other peoples code quickly
  - Distributed 50 ducks to enforce the power of the rubber ducky method
