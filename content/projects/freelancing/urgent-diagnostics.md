summary: proof of concept to ease the ent diagnostic process in urgent cares
---

# The Blurb

I was hired to develop an proof of concept web app for a company looking to automate the diagnosis process for urgent cares, with issues involving the ear, nose, and throat. I built a custom web over the course of 6 weeks and worked with the client to develop a proof of concept that was easy to show to future investors. 

# Features
  - login system for patient and provider
  - ranked likely hood of each diagnosis
  - Implemented the clients paper algorithm in software
  - Static webapp using React, AWS S3, AWS Lambda, and AWS Dynamo DB

We developed a computer application for urgent care medicine.  In order to bring it to the market, we needed a minimal viable product.  Arjun, in his last year at Worcester Polytechnic, looked over our material and developed a working website.  It had everything we wanted and is a vital asset to our Patented project. He was accurate, engaged, and innovative.  I respect his work and would support him for any job he would apply for.
