# Yeet

So I've had this dream for a really long time... 

Imagine a system where you could build really small apis and link them together inorder to create really complex behavior, and you could use timers to run those linked apis on a timer and ohmygoditwouldbeamazing. 

So for about a year I went down the rabbit hole of kubernetes, argo, distributed computing, and more. Turns out that building a Jarvis is hard... and expensive.

After another year of sitting with my finger in my butt tyrna figure out how to do any of this I stumbled upon a video by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob), he talked about how you could use filters to transform text in vim. And that was all I needed tip the boulder that sent me tumbling down the scripting rabbit hole.

I have discovered just how *cracked* linux's [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) really is specifically bash [filters](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Filters). 

I've been scripting like a mad man since I watched a video by a very opinionated man that showed me that you could execute bash commands inside of vim to transform the text you are working on.
