# The Blurb

My first deep dive into robotics was my highschool robotics team. There I worked on robots for vex, [BEST](https://www.bestrobotics.org/site/), and [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

# Other stuff I did while I was there
  - lead mechanical sub-team for 2 years
  - mentored the FLL team: [Robosharks](http://shakeragelementarystemlab.weebly.com/robotics-team-robosharks.html)
  - taught summer camps involving programming and robotics 
  - got maybe a bit to comfortable with an angle grindr
