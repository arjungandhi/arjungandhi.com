# The Blurb

This my first robotics class in college. The goal of the project was to design, build, and program a robot to play a [Savage Soccer] game from the previous year. Even though we were allowed to use vex metal / parts. I ended up using a laser cutter for the first time to design a completely custom robot from scratch. 

# What I did
I worked primarily on the CAD, mechanical design, and electrical wiring of this robot. 

# Features
  - laser cut body
  - designed in just under 2 days because I procrastinated. 
  - robot worked exactly until right after the demo.
