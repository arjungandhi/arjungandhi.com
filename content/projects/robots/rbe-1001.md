# The Blurb

RBE1001 was my first robotics class in college. The goal of the project was to design, build, and program a robot to play a [Savage Soccer] game from the previous year. Even though we were allowed to use pre-manufacture VEX parts and metal, I ended up using a laser cutter for the first time to design a completely custom robot from scratch. 

# What I did
I worked primarily on the CAD, mechanical design, and electrical wiring of this robot. 

# Features
  - Laser Cut body
  - CAD in SolidWorks 
  - Arduino-brained
  - Designed in just under 2 days because I procrastinated
  - Robot workes exactly until right after the demo
