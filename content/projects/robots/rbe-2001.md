# The Blurb

This robot was designed to be "nuclear powerplant" robot. The robot was tasked with moving rods of "nuclear fuel" around the field. The field communicates with the robot over bluetooth and the robot autonomously navigated around the field. The robot was able to receive emergency stop, resume and restart commands as well. 

# What I did
I focused on mainly on the mechanical and electrical design of the robot. I also worked little bit on some of the low level control.
